1. Code first approach 

* install some entity framwork 1. EFcore.sqlserver 2. EFcore.tools 3. EFcore.tools.dotnet
* create context folder and model class like employee
* create another file in same folder named like EmployeeDbContext that will inherit to dbcontext class
this class will contain all the model's information which are responsible for create the tables in the databae
and dbset like  DbSet<Employee> Employees { get; set; }  
* go to appsetting.json file and create connection string like this
"ConnectionStrings": {  
    "myconn": "server=ABC\\SQLEXPRESS2012; database=EmployeeDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"  
  } 
To use this connection string, first, we will change the ConfigureServices method in Startup.cs class as follows. 
services.AddMvc();  
    services.AddDbContext<EmployeeDbContext>(item => item.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("myconn")));
* open package manager console from tools menu and type "add-migration migrationname"... and you will see migration folder
with and same name that you have given...
* again type "update-database". if you have multiple migration than we should type "update-migration migrationanme" 

>>>>>>>>>> Now, let's modify the Employee model and add a new property as Salary
* first added new property to model class
* this time we have given the name of migration as 'addedsalary'."add-migration addedsalary"
* and same for update "add-migration addedsalary"
